        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Hello there, my name is Tam Nguyen. I am a senior student in Computer
            Science at Portland State Univerisity. I hope to graduate at the end of this year.
            Going to Computer Science is a challenge for me because I had no experience with any
            techniques with computer before. However, as approaching to finishing my undergraduate,
            I've had more interested in the major. It helps me to think more logically and
            force me to be more precise. Overall, I hope that the decision I make today will 
            reward me in the future. By the way, the picture you saw is me in my 
            traditional dress called "Ao Dai". I usually wore it in the Lunar New Year. 
            Hope you guys enjoy my personal website. Thank you.

            <p>
                Phone Call Track is designed to keep track all the phone calls 
                that client makes and receives from other people. The program will
                keep track with other information such as name, phone number, date,
                and time. Phone Call Track is later upgraded to Phone Bill App which
                is included next.

                from Phone Call Track, search from range of date, add, and remove phone bills 
                from multiples customers.
