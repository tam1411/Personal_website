                    Hello there, my name is Tam Nguyen. I am a senior student in Computer
                    Science at Portland State Univerisity. I hope to graduate at the end of this year.
                    Going to Computer Science is a challenge for me because I had no experience with any
                    techniques with computer before.
                    However, as approaching to finishing my undergraduate,
                    I've had more interested in the major. It helps me to think more logically and
                    force me to be more precise. Overall, I hope that the decision I make today will 
                    reward me in the future. By the way, the picture you saw is me in my 
                    traditional dress called "Ao Dai". I usually wore it in the Lunar New Year. 
                    Hope you guys enjoy my personal website. Thank you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Phone Call Track is designed to keep track all the phone calls 
                that client makes and receives from other people. The program will
                keep track with other information such as name, phone number, date,
                and time. Phone Call Track is later upgraded to Phone Bill App which
                is included next.

            <p>
                Phone Bill App is the final phase from Phone Call Track. Phone Bill App is 
                lauched by Android OS. In Phone Bill App, customer can have all the features
                from Phone Call Track, search from range of date, add, and remove phone bills 
                from multiples customers.
